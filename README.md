## Project 2: Draw Insights from Marketing Data
For this project, I was required to choose either the Google Merchandise Store or my own e-commerce business. I have selected Google Merchandise Store. I will assume the role of Marketing Manager for the selected business, where I will be responsible for ensuring successful online engagement and driving business growth. To achieve these objectives, I will focus on the following key areas:
  * Define the KPIs and business objectives for use in a measurement plan, along with the associated metrics for each KPI
  * Create a proposal for an A/B test to support a KPI
  * Get a strong grasp of the wide array of reports available in Google Analytics and what types of insights they offer.
  * Analyze information and generate suggestions to improve the business in direct response to data.
